# # signal_ICT_farhankaladiya_92400133131

A Python package demonstrating fundamental Signal Generation and Operations including unit step, impulse, ramp, sine, cosine, exponential signals, and signal manipulations such as time shifting, time scaling, addition, and multiplication. The package uses NumPy for computations and Matplotlib for plotting.

## Features

- Generate unit step, unit impulse, and ramp signals
- Generate sine, cosine, and exponential signals
- Perform signal operations: time shifting, time scaling, addition, multiplication
- Visualize signals using Matplotlib

## Installation
